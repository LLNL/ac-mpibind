1 - NUMA / hwloc_package
Late in the internship I realised (thanks to Edgar) that hwloc is not 
consistent with NUMA and packages objects. 
Sometimes package = NUMA, and others there are multiple NUMA in one package.
This might have led to small errors in the implementation.
I made some tests and everything seems fine with topologies that look like
I thought they all would (quartz, lassen_login, and so on). 
However it does not with the epyc_dual_soc one where packages contain
multiple numas. In this case my program only uses the first numa.

2 - GPU detection
In the mpibind script, finding the gpu used for computation is done by checking
there name. This is not done in the c implementation, thus the display gpus 
might be distributed by the algorithm and used for computation.

3 - Print function
My print function (mpibind_print) is not using strings and some glibc 
functions (I checked my code with valegrind and it finds invalid
write and jump/move).





Notes on the handle usage:
    - if mpibind_set_user_num_thread() is not used when initialising the handle
      or if -1 is set, then the target application will use one thread per
      process.
    - if 0 is set, then the application will be threaded and mpibind will
      compute the number of threads, using all the available threads.
